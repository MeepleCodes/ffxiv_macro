# FFXIV Macro Editor/Previewer
Completely over-the-top solution to offline editing of FFXIV macros in the authentic font.

A from-scratch text editor implemented in HTML Canvas so we can use the sprite-based fonts
extracted from FFXIV (which it uses instead of vector/TTF-based fonts).

## TODOs
Vague list of features still to implement
- Character picker
- Input mode for entering unicode
- Line wrapping and/or scrolling
- Kerning in the renderer
- Anything involving the mouse
- Drag/drop
